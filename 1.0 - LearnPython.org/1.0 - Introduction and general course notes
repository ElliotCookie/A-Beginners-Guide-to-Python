Already starting the file in plain text - nice!

I'm getting the next pack of my lessons from this website: https://www.learnpython.org/en/Welcome
I'm going to go through them and achieve a certain amount each day. 

New shortcut learned! Press CTRL + K, then M for languages to pop up. Then type Py to get python.
F2 renames a file that you've clicked on.

The style guide and what I'm assuming is a Python bible is here: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/



Lesson 1 is hello world - https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21____________________

% is the "modulo operator", which obviously doesn't actually help explain what it means at all...
a % b yields the remainder when a is divided by b. 
7 % 3  # → 1  (because 7 = 2×3 + 1)
10 % 2 # → 0  (because 10 is exactly divisible by 2)
% is a bit smart and if you give it a decimal the answer will be, if you give it ints only then that shall be your answer
Lets go back and have a play actually

== is the equality comparison operator
It will check if any two things match perfectly
If you give a string and an int ""four" == 4" then it will throw a false
Basically ensure your data type (array! or boolean or whatever is formatted, before you call it)

An f string allows you to run python within a string (basically a pre-compile?)
This allows for things like: print(f"The result of 14 % 5 is {14 % 5}")
This is important, as in a string function you can't just mash and int on the end of a str
