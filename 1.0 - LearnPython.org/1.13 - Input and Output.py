#Taking input and output is obviously a huge part of a useful computer programme
#Lets get into the big secret

myFirstInput = input() #yeah it's that easy
print(f"your first input was: {myFirstInput}")
#there is notes about spaces causing error but I reckon that was for 2.0

#it's probably good practise to sort your inputs into a data type
myFirstNumberInput = int(input())
print (myFirstNumberInput)
print("Lets try a decimal input and type a string!") #shock, we got an error and crash
decimalInput = float(input())
print(decimalInput)
print("end of that second bit")

#okay I need to get to bed, this will have to be a 2-parter with some easy
#kids coding tomorrow too
