""" Data can come in the incorrect format. 
Data from surveys and web forms can come to you with quality issues.
In this lesson, you'll learn to convert data to get it into the correct format. """

a = "14"
b = int(a)
c = input() # this will be a string

""" In a similar way, you can ensure that values are converted
into strings with the str() instruction.
Complete the code to convert the value into a string
 """
a = 2.9
b =str(a)


""" Lesson Takeaways
Great job! You learned that:

 

ðŸŒŸ you can change the data type of a value with int(), float() and str()

ðŸŒŸ there are implicit and explicit data type conversions in Python

ðŸŒŸ str(), int(), float() instructions are explicit conversions """
