""" Lists are incredibly useful in programming!
They let you store multiple values in a single variable, 
making your code more efficient.

In this lesson you'll learn to work with data stored in lists. """

animals = ["cat", "dog", "bird"]
print(animals[1])

#what will this code output?
products = ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"]
products[2] =  "lime"
print(products[2])

nums = [1, 5, 4, 8]

#Complete the code to output the sum of the first and third values in the list

print(nums[0] + nums[2])

""" Lesson Takeaways
Amazing! Now you know how to index!

Remember, lists are mutable, 
so they can be modified after they have been created. """
