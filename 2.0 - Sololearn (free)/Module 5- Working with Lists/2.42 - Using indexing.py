""" Indexing is a powerful technique that allows you to call part of a list.

In this lesson, you'll use indexing to work with single items inside a list. """

games = ["Snake", "Puzzle", "Shooter"]
games[1] = "Race"

products = ["juice", "chocolate", "water"]
user_choice = 1
print(products[user_choice])

animal = "Dog"
print(animal[0]) #A string is a list of chars

#Lists are mutable
#Srings are immutable
