""" What do a shopping list, a playlist, a box of chocolates,
 and a bookshelf have in common? They are all collections of items.

In this lesson you will learn how to work with collections in Python. """

item1 = "milk"
item2 = "tea"
item3 = "jam"

#Lists allow you to store a collection of multiple values in a single variable.
# Add square brackets [ ] around the values to create a list

cart = ["milk", "tea", "jam"]
#how many values are in the list? really??

#Lists can store any data type.
