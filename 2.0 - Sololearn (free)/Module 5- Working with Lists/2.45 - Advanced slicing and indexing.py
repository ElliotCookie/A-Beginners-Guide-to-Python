""" Indexing and slicing are incredibly useful,
allowing you to fully control the data you extract from sequences.

In this lesson you'll take your indexing and slicing skills to the next level. """

#that's not cool, just had a paywall lesson and then was asked for knowledge 
#within that lesson

#but the takeaway is that you can go backwards through a list with -ve indexing

c = ['$', 'Â£', 'â‚¬', 'Â¥']
print(c[-2:])

c = ['$', 'Â£', 'â‚¬', 'Â¥']
print(c[-3:-1]) #this gives you the middle 2

c = ['$', 'Â£', 'â‚¬', 'Â¥']
print(c[1:-1]) #so we still can do the 4 - 1 = 3, 3 - 1 = 2 output
#or more simply, 1 - - 1 = 2

""" Lesson Takeaways
You did it! You learned that:

ðŸŒŸ Python supports "indexing from the end" (negative indexing)

ðŸŒŸ The last value of a sequence has an index of -1 """


#quite a lot on this, is it THAT important?
