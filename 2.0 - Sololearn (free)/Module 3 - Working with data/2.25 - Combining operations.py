"""  Lesson Takeaways
You did it! You learned that:
 
ðŸŒŸ You can store boolean values in variables

ðŸŒŸ You can store the result of logical and comparison operations in variables

ðŸŒŸ You can combine operations with logical and comparison operators

In the next lesson, youâ€™ll learn to control the order in which computers """
