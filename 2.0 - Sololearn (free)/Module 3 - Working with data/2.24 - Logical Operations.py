""" Modern computers can perform complex tasks very fast because
these can be broken down into lots of tiny, simple calculations.

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn about another type of operation
that computers can do faster than humans. """

print(False and True)

#Right, so the truth table

#False and false = false
#false or false = false

#true and false = false
#---------------------------the break is here 
#true or false = TRUE

#true and true = true
#true or true = true


#What to remembr is or leans true, AND leans FALSE
#or is optimistic, it goes true
#then by extension, the other is just pessimistic 

""" Lesson Takeaways
Great work! You learned that:

 

ðŸŒŸ logical operations take multiple Boolean values as input

ðŸŒŸ logical operations produce a single Boolean value as output

ðŸŒŸ "and" and "or" are examples of logical operations """
