""" In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn about functions.

Functions are reusable blocks of code for specific tasks. 
They help keep your code as short and easy to work with as possible,
saving you from repeating code. """

#turns out print(), input() and type() are functions!

#Arguments go inside parentheses () after the function name.

help(range) #hehe
range(3) #will therefore give me 0, 1, 2

""" print() and range() are examples of built-in functions. 
Python has many built-in functions which you can re-use
 in your code by calling them.
What's an example of another built-in function that you 
have used earlier in this course? """
#hmm

""" Lesson Takeaways
Great job! You learned that:

ðŸŒŸ Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks

ðŸŒŸ Functions make your code more organized

ðŸŒŸ Information to complete the task is passed as arguments """
