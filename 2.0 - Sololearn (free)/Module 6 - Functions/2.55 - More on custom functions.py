""" Custom (or user-defined) functions help to break a large 
program down into small segments to make it easy to understand,

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn to build more advanced custom functions. """

#A function can return multiple values. The function rect() helps a real 
# estate agency calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangular parcel of land.
#  It takes the two dimensions of the parcel as arguments

""" Multiple return values need to be separated by commas. 
When a function returns multiple values,
they can be stored in multiple variables (on 1 line).  """

#To create multiple variables in 1 statement, separate them with commas.

 gets its default value """

""" Lesson Takeaways
Congratulations! In this lesson you learned that:
 
ðŸŒŸ A function can return multiple values

ðŸŒŸ Defining a function also decides the data types it can take in, handle and return

ðŸŒŸ Default values make arguments optional """
