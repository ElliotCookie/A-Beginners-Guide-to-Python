""" Functions can take operations as arguments. 

As an example, the print() function can accept math,
logical and comparison operations. """

x = "air"
y = "plane"
print(x + y)

balance = 304
print("Money in account:", balance)
#very clever

#A function can be an argument for another function. E.g.:
print(type(x))

num = '45' # string
print(int(num) + 3)
