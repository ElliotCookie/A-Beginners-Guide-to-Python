""" Computers are capable of making decisions, 
and help us solve real-world problems because they 
are very good at following instructions.

In this lesson, you'll learn to control the flow of instructions
 a computer follows, using 3 techniques: 
 sequencing, iteration and selection. """

#Put the outputs in the order they will be displayed
#am I a joke to you

#I like that they are showing these things as flowcharts

""" An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to complete a task,
 placed in a certain order. """

#I got this wrong twice!
#Flowchat shows selection and sequencing
#For attendance score this is 


""" Lesson Takeaways
Fantastic job! You learned that:

 

ðŸŒŸ You use sequencing, iteration and selection to
 control the flow of instructions

ðŸŒŸ An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to complete a task

ðŸŒŸ Algorithms can be represented in different ways """
