""" Iteration is used to automate tasks that need to
 be done over and over again. 

Iteration makes your programs simpler, faster and reduces errors.
In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to create for loops. """

#The for loop begins with the keyword for. 
# The variable i keeps track of the number of iterations.

for i in range(100):
  print("Hello")

#remember range(5) generates 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

for i in range(5):
    print("Congrats!") #indentation is important


"""  Lesson Takeaways
Great work! You learned that:
 

ðŸŒŸ you can implement iteration into your programs with the for loop

ðŸŒŸ the initial loop statement must be followed by a colon : symbol

ðŸŒŸ the code that gets repeated must be indented """
