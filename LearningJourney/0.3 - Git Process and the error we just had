I just tried to commit but that didn't work for ages, was wondering why
It's because I didn't put in a message to the commit, and it was taking ages because there was a pop up I didn't close (I thought it was a summary)
I'm going to commit this and then create a new branch to test out what I've learned in the feedback cycle
