Levels of branches
___________GIT_____________

Hotfix - emergency fixes!
Main - (or master), production ready code, official releases
Release - pre-release staging area, final testing happens here
Develop - inegration branch where features are merged
Feature - individual branches for new features


Start in main, makes sense
Push down to develop branch, this level serves to collect features

Different dev teams on different features, so they pull a copy of the code from develop
Make feature and then push it back to the develop main branch
The question is, do other feature teams then pull this completed feature or not?

Once main develop branch has enough features, this is reviewed, pushed up to release layer
Release engineers review this, it'll be called 1.0 or something
If it's good then it's pushed up to main and that's sold or whatever
The same code is then pulled down by the develop team, who start over 
(perhaps some changes were made by release reviewing engineer)

If it's then found that there is an error (!!), hot fix jumps into action
They get to bypass all that faff, they do the fix and issue down to main
This will be rev 1.1, and sold to customers
It is also issued down to development team as that is the newest official version
The question is, do they then have to just adopt this and start over, is it merged into what they have?
Hypothetically all the work is being done on a feature branch anyway

Answers to questions:
1. There can be conflict - tough! Regularly sync with develop, talk and break features down
All feature teams should be pulling the development branch
2. Hotfix is merged into main and develop. Feature team pulls the devlop branch.
They can adjust the hotfix (so they don't write off progress) and then push this back up to the develop branch

THIS IS QUITE REVIEW AND PUSH/PULL INTENSIVE!!



Github 
Works generally because features are isolated
Needs a mature team and good engineers
Git falls down because if eg 1 of 5 features has a bug then the whole release is shot
By doing small and often you can get around this (if bug just roll back to prev ver)

Basically you go
Main -> feature -> (pre production maybe) -> main (!!)
