I wanted to do a side project and didn't want this to be tracked by all the handy
git and GH tools

For that there are two funcitons you need

The first is to go into the terminal at the bottom and type:
git checkout --detach

This will then put you on a new random branch with no name
When you want to log in, ensure your terminal in vs code says the correct thing,
basically it needs to be going to the folder that has a (hidden) .git file in it already
Git needs to know about the folder!
You then type
git checkout MainBranch

and this puts you back into the branch


Also a note
When snycing, this pulls the repo and then pushes. 
In a team situation, obviously the pull could have conflicts to resolve
